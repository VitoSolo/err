								<h3>East River Roustabout, LLC</h3>
                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/well-2.jpg" style="width: 160px" alt="oil well" /></span>East River emerged as a response to the frustrations experienced by our affiliate upstream operator. They observed that roustabout services were frequently treated as an afterthought, provided by unsafe, under-skilled, and under-capitalized service providers. These providers seemed more focused on maximizing profits for individual jobs rather than consistently delivering high-quality, safe performance for the essential small-scale tasks that arise day after day.<br><br></p>
                                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                                <p>With a combined 44 years of experience in pipeline and roustabout services, our team leaders, Richard Staton, Grady Briley, Tim Prince, and Miguel Tafoya, have a proven track record of success on projects for major energy companies such as DCP Midstream, EnLink Midstream, Teocalli Exploration, among many others.</p>
								<p>All East River team leads possess the appropriate Operator Qualifications ("OQ") in Veriforce for tank battery, pipeline, and compressor station projects.  East River is a member of Veriforce Compliance Pro and ISNetworld.
