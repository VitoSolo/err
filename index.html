								<h2>Emphasis on safety</h2>
								<p>East River emerged as a response to the frustrations experienced by our affiliate upstream operator. They observed that roustabout services were frequently treated as an afterthought, provided by unsafe, under-skilled, and under-capitalized service providers. These providers seemed more focused on maximizing profits for individual jobs rather than consistently delivering high-quality, safe performance for the essential small-scale tasks that arise day after day.</p>
